# Grid { #jax_idem.utilities.Grid }

```python
utilities.Grid()
```

"
A simple grid class to store (currently exclusively regular) grids, along
with some key quantities such as the lenth between grid points, the
number of grid points and the area/volume of each grid square/cube.
Supports arbitrarily high dimension.
Ideally, in the future, this will support non-regular grids with any
necessary quantities to do, for example, integration over the points on the
grid.
