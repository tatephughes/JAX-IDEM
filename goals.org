#+Title: Tasks

* CURRENT GOALS 15/04/25

** TODO Parallel Kalman Filter(s)
*** TODO Is the parallel square root filter possible?

** TODO It should also be possible to implement a infinite-initial-variance to all(?) or the filters; confirm and implement this!

** TODO Smoothers (sqrt, information, and the corresponding lag-1 smoothers)
*** TODO EM algorithm follows quickly, implement to test
*** TODO Corresponding parallel equivalents as well

** TODO Clean and update documentation, particularily docstrings
*** TODO Continue the mathematics page, correcting any errors and expanding and completing
*** TODO Once documentation is cleaned up and certain rubbish is removed, a proper published early version of the package is nearly ready

** TODO Remove (or at least git-ignore) unnessecary or outdated scripts

** TODO Implement prediction for the filters
- Is relatively simple wiht these algorithms, just add a new argument to each filter to predict for that many extra time steps. 
*** TODO Also, backcasting for the smoothers

** TODO Complete and test the ~fit_mle~ and ~sample_posterior~ interfaces for ~idem.Model~

** TODO Finish analysing the Sydney Radar explorative example
- Include visualisation, discussion, complete the two MCMC examples, introduce using BlackJax for HMC, cover using the  ~fit_mle~ and ~sample_posterior~ methods above for ease of use
*** TODO As an extra side, I want to look at the German air quality data, due to it's challenging missing data. 
*** TODO Also, try finding a data set with which to test /invariant/ kernels

** Other MCMC related tasks
*** TODO Tuning is a problem right now!
  DEADLINE: <2025-04-22 Tue>
- preconditioning
  
** Speed improvements
*** TODO Find what parts of likelihood computation are cumbersome
- I believe the ~con_M~ method is somewhat of a bottleneck right now?
- Integration is done rather Naively right now (the same as in R-IDE), perhaps a better method could be used?
  
** TODO Compare the filters!
- Especially once the parralel filters are implemented, I want to expand on how they all compare, especially as process & observation dimension change.

** Other improvements to do
*** TODO Re-work how covariate data is handled
- I'm not happy with the relative clunkyness of it right now.
*** TODO Improve how data can be placed during the initialisation to automate things like grid placements
- ~init_model~ will implement this!

** Get Hamilton Access and test with some large chains
DEADLINE: <2025-04-22 Tue>

- apptainer for Hamilton
- check that MALA and RMH are targetting the same posterior
